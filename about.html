        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>To foster a vibrant community through sports and cultural engagement.</p>
        <p>The IISc Gymkhana is the sports and culture hub for the faculty and students of our prestigious, century-old Institute. IISc is not just a home for some of the brightest minds of the country, it also has a significant number of athletes, actors, musicians, artists and sports persons who have represented themselves and the Institute at various levels. The Gymkhana provides all possible facilities, infrastructure and support, so that students can pursue extracurricular activities along with their research work. The Gymkhana is spread over a vast area of 26 acres in a very scenic part of the campus. At present, there are 27 clubs (sports and cultural) active in the Gymkhana.

The IISc Gymkhana is currently administered by Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati. He is working as the President of Gymkhana, since May 1st, 2017, with Mr. N Krishna Murthy as the Section Officer. The Gymkhana administration is supported by the Gymkhana Student Affairs Committee (GSAC) whose role is to co-ordinate the various club activities and act as an interface between the students and the Gymkhana administration. Additionally, each club of the Gymkhana has a representative who is designated as the Club Convener. The GSAC members are elected each year from among the students of IISc.

The IISc Gymkhana coordinates and organizes various events throughout the year to maintain the environment of fun, unity and optimism in the Institute. Events organized by the Gymkhana include the Independence Day Run, Republic Day Run, and a once-a-year event showcasing the sports and cultural activities of the clubs of the Gymkhana.

In order for any individual to excel at the frontiers of science and technology, it is essential to have a healthy body and a healthy mind. The IISc Gymkhana provides the right environment for the faculty and students in this endeavour.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Gymkhana has been a cornerstone of student life at IISc, promoting physical fitness and cultural exchange
            The new Club House, defrayed by Sir. D. J. Tata, was completed during the first term of the session and
was informally opened on November 16, 1924, by Mr. C. W. E. Cotton, who assisted the Committee in
framing a constitution. His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore graciously consented to become the
Patron, and the club opened its first year of activity under the presidency of Professor J. K. Catterson-
Smith. The formal opening took place on March 16, 1925, when Sir. D. J. Tata performed the ceremony
in presence of numerous guests. The fourth tennis-court has been brought into use, the cricket-field
has been enlarged, and a Badminton-court is being laid.</p>
