<h2>About Gymkhana</h2>
<section><p>History of Gymkhana:
â€¢
The new Club House, defrayed by Sir. D. J. Tata, was completed during the first term of the session and 
was informally opened on November 16, 1924, by Mr. C. W. E. Cotton, who assisted the Committee in 
framing a constitution. His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore graciously consented to become the 
Patron, and the club opened its first year of activity under the presidency of Professor J. K. Catterson-
Smith. The formal opening took place on March 16, 1925, when Sir. D. J. Tata performed the ceremony 
in presence of numerous guests. The fourth tennis-court has been brought into use, the cricket-field 
has been enlarged, and a Badminton-court is being laid.</p><p>Centenary Year
